# python_learning

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is where I put some of my fun projects as I learn Python.
Each folder/script is a small program I made while practicing new conceptsâ€”things like printing star pyramids, making a number guessing game, and more.


## My Projects

| Project Name | What's Inside | What I Learned |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------------- |
| [`stars.py`](https://github.com/heermdesai/python_learning/blob/main/stars.py) | Takes a number input and prints that many stars. | Practiced **while loops**, taking **keyboard input**, and writing my **first functions**. |
| [`pyramid.py`](https://github.com/heermdesai/python_learning/blob/main/pyramid.py) | Takes a number and builds a centered pyramid with that many layers. | Got comfortable with **for loops**, **nested loops**, and using Pythonâ€™s `end` parameter to control output formatting. |
